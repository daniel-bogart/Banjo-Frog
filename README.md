### Gameplay
The gameplay involves five seperate keys on the keyboard representing strings. Each key, correlated to a given string, must be pressed while a vertical note on a 
downward path crosses a horizontal plain. Ten points will be added to a total score for each hit, five subtracted for each wrong key press, and zero points for a miss.
After the song ends and the notes stop, one of four outcomes will be displayed for the player based on their final score.
