        You are a friendly amphibious creature performing a song on
        the banjo at the county fair. Five lanes representing the 
        five strings on a banjo will produce "notes" at the top of 
        the lane that will make their way at a set pace toward the 
        bottom/head of the banjo. You will need to master your timing 
        in order to hit keys on the keyboard representing each of the 
        five strings as they overlap on a perpendicular line on the 
        fretboard. If you successfully hit a note, 10 points will be 
        added to your score. If you miss a note or hit the wrong one 
        by mistake, five points will be subtracted from your total 
        score. If you are able to score over 900 points by the end of 
        the song, you will win! Otherwise you may try again in a new 
        game!
      </p>

        Use the keys A, S, D, F, and G to pluck strings!
